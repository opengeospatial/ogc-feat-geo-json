# Contributing

The contributor understands that any contributions, if accepted by the OGC Membership, shall be incorporated into OGC standards documents and that all copyright and intellectual property shall be vested to the OGC.

The OGC Features and Geometries JSON Standards Working Group (SWG) is the group at OGC responsible for the stewardship of the standard, but is working to do as much work in public as possible.

## Propose a change to a draft of a specification document

GitHub is used to develop the specification(s) using the following process:

* The "master" branch is the editors' draft.
* To propose a change, edit the AsciiDoc files for the draft document in a branch or fork of the master branch.
  * If you want to propose multiple changes, use separate branches so that the working group can discuss and accept or reject changes individually.
* Commit the changes to a branch on GitHub.
* Create a pull request for the branch or fork and submit it.
* The working group will discuss pull requests and approved pull requests will be merged by the editors. The editors will also regenerate the HTML document to keep the AsciiDoc and HTML versions of the editors' draft in sync.

## How to submit pull requests

This assumes that you are familiar with *git* and *GitHub*. GitHub offers training courses, for example, [Introduction to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/).

One of the following two workflows are recommended. In both cases the AsciiDoc and other files are edited locally in a branch. The difference is whether the git command line interface is used or the GitHub Desktop tools.

### Use the GitHub Desktop tools

The steps below link to a tutorial from GitHub. Please keep in mind that you will not edit pages of some website, but the AsciiDoc files of the OGC Features and Geometries JSON standard.

* [Install GitHub Desktop](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/)
* [Clone the Repository](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/clone-repository-github-desktop), use https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-feat-geo-json as the repository
* [Create Local Branches](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/create-branches-github-desktop)
* [Make Local Changes](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/make-changes-github-desktop), ignore the specific discussion related to GitHub Pages.
* [Add Local Commits](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/add-commits-github-desktop)
* [Open a Pull Request](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/pull-request-github-desktop)

Note that as the editors' draft is updated after the merge of a pull request into the master branch, you should [update your local copy](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-with-github-desktop) before making new edits to lower the risk of conflicts.

### Use the Git command line interface

If the Mac Git Bash command-line tool is preferred, consider learning the steps described at the [Code School Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
