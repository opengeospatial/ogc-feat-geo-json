[big]*i.     Abstract*

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON] is a very popular encoding for feature data. GeoJSON is widely supported, including in most deployments of APIs implementing the OGC API Features Standard. However, GeoJSON has intentional restrictions that prevent or limit its use in certain geospatial application contexts. For example, GeoJSON is restricted to WGS 84 coordinates, does not support volumetric geometries and has no concept of classifying features according to their type.

OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) is a proposal for GeoJSON extensions that provide standard ways to support such requirements. The goal is to focus on capabilities that may require some geospatial expertise, but that are useful for many. Edge cases are considered out-of-scope of JSON-FG.

Since JSON-FG specifies extensions to GeoJSON that conform to the GeoJSON standard, valid JSON-FG documents are also valid GeoJSON documents.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites organisations and developers that have a need for the extensions specified by this specification to implement and test the extensions. Please submit feedback in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json/issues[GitHub repository of the specification]. Are these extensions useful for your use cases? Are they simple enough to implement?

NOTE: There are a number of https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json/projects/1[open issues under discussion] at the time of the release of this draft (version 0.2). Notes in this document link to related issues in the GitHub repository.

Uptake in implementations and sufficient feedback from implementation experience will be a prerequisite for this specification to eventually progress towards an OGC Standard.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT. The technical requirements specified in this document can change in future versions.
