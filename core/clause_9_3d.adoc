== Requirements Class "3D"

The "3D" Requirements Class adds provisions for volumetric geometries in a 3D CRS that may be of type <<Polyhedron>>, <<MultiPolyhedron>>, <<Prism>>, or <<MultiPrism>>.

^|*Requirement {counter:req-num}* |/req/{req-class}/{req}
^|A |The "conformsTo" member of a JSON-FG object that contains any of the volumetric geometry objects SHALL include at least the following value: `"http://www.opengis.net/spec/json-fg-1/{m_n}/conf/{req-class}"`.

=== Geometry

:req: coordinate-dimension
[#{req-class}_{req}]
==== Coordinate dimension

[width="90%",cols="2,7a"]
|===
^|*Requirement {counter:req-num}* |/req/{req-class}/{req}
^|A |All positions in a "Polyhedron" or "MultiPolyhedron" geometry object in the "place" member in any JSON-FG feature object SHALL have a coordinate dimension of three (3) - or four (4), if measure values are included (see <<rc_measures>>).

:req: geom-valid
[#{req-class}_{req}]
==== Geometries are valid

[width="90%",cols="2,7a"]

^|*Requirement {counter:req-num}* |/req/{req-class}/{req}
^|A |If the "place" member in any JSON-FG feature object is not `null` and the geometry type (member "type") is "Polyhedron", the elements in the "coordinates" array SHALL meet the following requirements:

* Each element is a closed, simple multi-polygon geometry (a shell).
* The coordinates of the first and last position in each ring of each polygon in each shell SHALL be identical.
* If the shell is viewed from the outside of the solid, the orientation of each polygon in the first element (the outer shell) SHALL be counter clockwise.
* If the shell is viewed from the outside of the solid, the orientation of each polygon in all other shells (the voids) SHALL be clockwise.
* No element (shell) intersects another element (shell).
* All coordinates in the elements from the second element to the last element (the voids) are inside the simple polyhedron specified by the first element (the outer shell).
* In the elements from the second element to the last element (the voids) there is no element where all coordinates of the element are inside the shell specified by another element (no void contains another void).
^|B |If the "place" member in any JSON-FG feature object is not `null` and the geometry type (member "type") is "MultiPolyhedron", each element in the "coordinates" array SHALL be a valid polyhedron geometry (see A).
^|C |If the "place" member in any JSON-FG feature object is not `null` and the geometry type (member "type") is "Prism", the base geometry (member "base") SHALL be one of "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon" or "MultiPolygon", and each geometry object SHALL be a valid geometry according to <<ogc06_103r4,Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>.
^|D |If the "place" member in any JSON-FG feature object is not `null` and the geometry type (member "type") is "MultiPrism", each prism (items in the member "prisms") SHALL be a valid Prism geometry.

Clients should, if possible, be tolerant and also accept shells with an incorrect orientation.
