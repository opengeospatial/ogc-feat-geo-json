== Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

This test suite uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then[Given-When-Then] notation to specify the tests.

The test suite is organized into sections that correspond to the requirements classes in the main body of the document. Each section contains a set of tests that validate the requirements specified in that requirements class.

Given:

* The JSON-FG root object under test;
* the JSON-FG root object has passed the conformance test /conf/core/schema-valid;
* the JSON-FG root object is a JSON-FG feature or feature collection;

When:

* collect all schemas referenced from "featureSchema" members;

Then:

* assert that all referenced schemas conform to <<OAFeat-5,OGC API - Features - Part 5: Schemas>>, requirements class "Schemas".
